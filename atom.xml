<p>In the digital age, internet becomes a rich source of information and maintains network of human social contact. Existing research linking internet usage and teenagers’ cognition outcome focus on the direct exposure of internet users rather than the impact through guardian. In this paper, we use micro data from CFPS to examines the effects of guardian’s choice of using internet on teenager’s cognition achievement. CFPS surveys have been conducted every twice a year since 2010, and it contains a rich set of variables on personal information, parental background, and cognition outcome which allows us to use panel data analysis to identify the causal effect. We find that guardian’s internet usage has a sizable and significant positive effect on teenager’s cognition achievement measured by test scores. Further explore of mechanism shows that both direct channel like learning resources and indirect channel like parental environment are improved for internet using guardian. Heterogeneous analysis shows that the impact is stronger for guardian in rural areas with low education level. The result suggests that promoting internet for the less educated family in rural region can potentially make up the negative background and decrease inequality transmitted across generation.</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Cognition refers to the capability of analyzing information, solving problems, and making  decisions.   It  measures  the  variation  of  human  capital  and  is strongly  related  toeducation attainment (Jencks et al., 1972; Zagorsky, 2007; Bourne et al., 2018) and latelabor outcome (Thienpont and Verleye, 2004); Heckman et al., 2005).  Better cognitionperformance  reduces  school  dropout  rate  (Belley  and  Lochner,  2007;  Korenman  andWinship,  2000),  lowers  participation  in  crime  (Frisell  et  al.,  2012;  Tittle  et  al.,  2003)and increases wage payment (Thienpont and Verleye, 2004).  From macro perspective,national cognition level is highly related to economic performance.  Hanushek and Kimko(2000) studied the math and science test scores of 31 countries and found that nationalcognition improvements positively affect annual real GDP growth.  China ranks highlyon cognition performance, from the perspective of national IQ index, Chinese ranks thesecond highest among the th</p>
